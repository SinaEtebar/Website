<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>1. Classical electromagnetism (with no sources) follows from the action</p>

$$ S = \int d^{4}x \Big(-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\Big),\;\;\;\;\;\text{where}\;F_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}. $$

<p>(a) Derive Maxwellâ€™s equations as the Euler-Lagrange equations of this action, treating the components $A_{\mu\nu}$ as the dynamical variables. Write the equations in standard form by identifying $E^{i} = -F^{0i}$ and $\epsilon^{ijk}B^{k} = -F^{ij}$.</p> 
<p>(b) Construct the energy-momentum tensor for this theory. Note that the usual procedure does not result in a symmetric tensor. To remedy that, we can add to $T^{\mu\nu}$ a term of the form $\partial_{\lambda}K^{\lambda\mu\nu}$, where $K^{\lambda\mu\nu}$ is antisymmetric in its first two indices. Such an object is automatically divergenceless, so</p>

$$ \hat{T}^{\mu\nu} = T^{\mu\nu} + \partial_{\lambda} K^{\lambda\mu\nu}$$

<p>is an equally good energy-momentum tensor with the same globally conserved energy and momentum. Show that this construction, with</p>

$$ K^{\lambda\mu\nu} = F^{\mu\lambda} A^{\nu}, $$

<p>leads to an energy-momentum tensor T that is symmetric and yields the standard formulae for the electromagnetic energy and momentum densities:</p>

$$ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2} (E^2+B^2);\;\;\;\; S = E\times B. $$

<p>2. Evaluate the function</p>

$$ \bra{0} \phi(x)\phi(y) \ket{0} = D(x-y) = \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{1}{2E_{P}} e^{-ip(x-y)}, $$

<p>for $(x-y)$ spacelike so that $(x-y)^2 = -r^2$,  explicitly in terms of Bessel functions.</p>
