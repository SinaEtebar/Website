<p>In 224 CE, Ardashir I successfully overcame Ardawan (Artabanus IV) at the plain of Hormozgan to found the Sasanian Empire. Ardashir thereafter adopted the title "King of Kings" and started ruling.</p>

<p>In 240 CE, Shabuhr I, Ardashir's son, was appointed as his co-regent. A coin depicting both men together makes this clear, and Ardashir likely ordered it to establish a secure succession. This was due to the possibility that other sons of his who had been granted control over other provinces might have desired to ascend to the throne, as he did in his youth.</p>
