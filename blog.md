      I recently tried to use solar neutrino flux data for calculations and I couldn't find any Python code for plotting them so I did it by myself.<br>

      Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a theoretical framework for physics that combines the ideas of classical field theory and quantum mechanics. It is a cornerstone of contemporary theoretical physics and is essential to our comprehension of the fundamental forces and particles in the cosmos.<br>

      Classical Electrodynamics is the branch of theoretical physics that studies the interactions between electric charges and currents using classical principles, without involving quantum mechanics. It's a fundamental theory that describes how electric and magnetic fields behave and how they influence the motion of charged particles.<br>
